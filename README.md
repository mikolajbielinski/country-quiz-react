<h1>Country quiz using react</h1>

<h2>In Country quiz app you have to show your knowledge about countries all around the world!</h2>

<h2>Created the app using styled-components, react-router-dom v6 and rest countries API.</h2>

I created the same app in vanilla js and now in react to learn how React is helping in certain situations.
